//==============================================================================

// This container is an array that is capable of being appended to in an
// thread safe manner by use of atomics. It only provides protection for the
// use cases currently present in OpenMC. Namely, it covers the scenario where
// multiple threads are appending to an array, but no threads are reading from
// or operating on it in any other way at the same time. Multiple threads can
// call the thread_safe_append() function concurrently and store data to the
// object at the index returned from thread_safe_append() safely, but no other
// operations are protected.

class SharedArray {

public:
  //==========================================================================
  // Constructors

  //! Default constructor.
  SharedArray() = default;

  // Note: the destructor is not defined due to OpenMP offloading
  // restrictions.  The problem is that since the SharedArray is a
  // global variable that is accessed beyond the local scope of a target
  // construct (i.e., from within a function in a target region), the
  // variable must be marked as "declare target". When doing so with a
  // global variable a copy is constructed in place on device and will
  // therefore also be destructed in place on device (which involves
  // dynamic memory usage as well as calling delete on a mapped host
  // pointer).
